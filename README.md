# Slyrex Arma3 Helpful Server Scripts
 This is just a project to make simple scripts for help for arma3, such as automatically formatting mods from a folder etc, the current project does as follows:
 It is a simple gui which will select and remember your MOD folder and your param file and will automatically update your param file with the correct formatting for mods after the mod=@test123;test;123 etc.
    It will remember the mods you have unfiltered incase you didn't want to load a specific mod, making it much easier to quickly update a modlist to your params when you've downloaded a new mod set for a campaign instead of copy and pasting.


    Initial - added functionality to format mods

    v2 - added GUI and functionality to auto update param file

    v3 - added settings.json to remember unfiltered mods

    v4 - added choose your own path for param file and mods folder, save settings for path functionality and mods folder and will load and remember them

    More to come, please request suggestions to make your life easier.
